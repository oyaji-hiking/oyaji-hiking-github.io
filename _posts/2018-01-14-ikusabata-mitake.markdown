Part way along the road at the start of the hike, is a nice looking small shrine on the right hand side, also keep a look out for the chestnut and mikan fruit trees on the right.

After the initial road section the route becomes forest trail, continue following the signs and after about an hour since leaving Ikusabata station, there is a rest area, a good place to stop and have some breakfast.

Near to the top of Takamizusan there is a shrine, it is worth following the path round to the right, to enter the shrine from the main entrance, from the shrine continue to the top of Takamizusan, the first peak on the hike.

After Takamizusan, the trail begins to traverse a ridge line on the way to the next peak, Iwatakesan (岩茸石山), the trail is well signed.

The top of Iwatakesan (793m) is open, and provides some great views of the surrounding area out to the far horizon:

Continue the trail to the next and last peak, Sogakusan (惣岳山)
![2018-01-14-10.48.07-1](/content/images/2018/01/2018-01-14-10.48.07-1.jpg)
![2018-01-14-10.47.35-1](/content/images/2018/01/2018-01-14-10.47.35-1.jpg)

Sogakusan (760m) is covered in forest, and is rather dark and gloomy after the open area at the top of Iwatakesan.

After Sogakusan, the forest trail winds mostly downhill, for approx 4km until reaching the end of the hike in Mitake.

Entering Mitake from the forest, look for the railroad crossing point, walk across the tracks to the otherside to get to the front side of the station and Mitake high st.

**Post Hike :**

Just along from Mitake station, heading right with tracks behind, there is an excellent soba restaurant. Be sure to also try the sake.

Just a little further along from the restaurant is a house doubling up as a cafe.
They have numerous kotatsu for use by the customers, some outside on a balcony over looking the small valley and river at the back. Head here after the restaurant for coffee and dessert :
