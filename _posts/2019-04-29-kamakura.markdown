There quite a few options of where to end the hike. If visiting the beach towards end of hike, it is fun to take a train back to Kamakura stn from [Hase stn](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hase+Station/@35.3153013,139.5323417,14.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x601845f1aec387b5:0x808fc2bbe9294ff8!8m2!3d35.3112818!4d139.5358676) using the [Enoshima electric-train line](https://www.enoden.co.jp/en/train/)

**Walking Time** a few hours, depending on stops at shrines and cafes etc..

**Difficult** Very easy 1/5. Short distance, no steep sections, gentle trails, and roads. 

**Getting There** trains for Kita-Kamakura run from a few stations, e.g., Tokyo, and Ebisu station, transfer may be required for example at Ofuna, a few stops before Kita-Kamakura.

**The Hike**

There are quite a few trails around the area and an abundance of old shrines and temples, making the area a great day out for visitors to Japan. 

From Kita-Kamakura train station follow signs for Jochi temple. Its worth the 200yen entrance fee to walk around the quiet temple grounds, which sits in what feels like an old stone quarry, surrounded by natural rocky tree covered walls.

Especially if it is a nice sunny day, its worth a walk down to the beach about 10 mins from the Daibutsu.

Kamakura has an abundance of Soba noodle restaurants, so be sure to have some nice lunch and a beer before heading home.
