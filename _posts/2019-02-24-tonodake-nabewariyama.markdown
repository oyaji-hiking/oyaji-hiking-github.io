**The Hike**

Set off up the road to the left of the Okura center, when standing facing the front of the building. The road runs for about a kilometer or so where it turns to cobble stone paving and then forest trail.

The way to the top of Tonodake (塔ノ岳) is not complicated, and is well signed. The trail is a series of steep climbs interspersed with flat or more gentle up and down sections.

Be sure to take a break at the many well positioned rest places, as they are typically situated just before the next steep climb.

It is 7km to the top, where there is a nice rest hut where refreshments can be purchased. The hut is not so large inside and can be crowded when the weather is not to great. The top of Mt Tonodake affords great "360 degree" views of the surrounding geography, including views of the Japanese alps and Mt Fuji on a clear day.

Head back down the same way for a short distance and there is a trail off to the right that leads to Mt Nabewari ( Nabewariyama / 鍋割山 ) about 2.5km away. It is a very pleasent hike to Nabewariyama. The peak has a nice hut with a few benches out front and a grassy space great for a picnic. Nabewariyama, is famous for its Nabeyaki udon dish which can be bought at the hut.

From Nabewariyama, it is a long steep downhill to the valley below, about 6km.

Then 5km more, with the last few kilometers of roadway, to eventually arrive back in Okura village.

Look out for the vegetables being sold at the roadside, and be sure to check out the great soba restaurant in front of the bus terminal, before getting the bus back to Shibusawa stn, and the train back to Tokyo.
