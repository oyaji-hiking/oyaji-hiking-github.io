From Tokyo, take Odakyu line train from Shinjuku station to Hadano station ( approx 1 hour for express train ). From Hadano take the bus to Minoge, approx 20mins. At Hadano station look for exit signs to the Bus stop for Yabitsu pass and Minoge to get to the correct location for the bus. 

**The Hike**

From the bus stop at Minoge, take the road opposite, ( look for the statue of the small boy ), the roadway lasts for about 1 km, and then gives way to the hiking trail, where a small wooden bridge crosses a stream.

At the Yabitsu bus area, set off for about another km downhill along the road until picking up signs for Mt. Tonodake and Mt. Sannoto. Take a short detour of 100m before heading back onto the trail to visit a water feature where water bottles can be topped up with spring water

The climb up to the top of Mt. Sannoto is quite steep and long, but the views near and at the top are well worth the effort.

From here the trail heads downhill and then back up to finally get to the peak, where some awesome views await

Near the end, the trail turns into roadway again, look for and take the large suspension bridge which crosses the river to Okura bus terminal area, where a bus can be taken back to Shibusawa train station and back to Shinjuku in Tokyo.

However....

Before taking the bus back, be sure to have some lunch at the Soba restaurant just across the road from the bus stop area. Don't forget to sample the Sake too!
