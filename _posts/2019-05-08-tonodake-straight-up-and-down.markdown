Details of how to get to and from Mt Tonodake are shown in earlier post [here](https://oyaji-hiking.saigos.space/tonodake-nabewariyama/) 

This hike was a straight forward hike from the Okura bus stop starting point, to the Tonodake peak, and back down the same way, approx 14km in total.

Okura center and bus stop, the starting point.
