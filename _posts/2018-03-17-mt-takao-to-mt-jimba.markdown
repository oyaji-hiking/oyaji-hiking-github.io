To the left of the center when facing it, as shown in the pic above, is the start of the Inariyama trail, to the top of Mt. Takao, which is the first leg of the hike.  This trail follows the forest path, and avoids the busy tourist routes and shrines.

The hike to the top takes about 1 hour, and is mostly under trees, on forest trail, but at approx. halfway up there is a scenic view point with a small shelter and some seats, a good place to stop and catch breath.

The top of Takao is 599m, and on a clear day there is a very nice view of Mt Fuji.

From the top just to the right of the area shown in the photo above there is the start of the path for the remainder of the hike, a sign shows the main peaks visited along the way to Mt. Jimba, and approx walking times.

![2018-03-17-08.28.52](/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-08.28.52.jpg)

The majority of the rest of the hike is on well maintained and well signed trails. Follow the trail signs for the places as shown in the sign above.

Closer to Jimba, there are a couple of options to head to the bus stop earlier, without having to go to the top of Mt. Jimba. The first is 2.4km from Mt. Jimba, and 2.8km to the bus stop, as shown above. The next is 1.5km from Mt. Jimba, and a little harder to spot, as below :

**Getting Home**

From Mt. Jimba it is 4km to 5km to get back to the bus stop, to get the bus back to Takao town train station, and train back to Tokyo. There are two options, 1) Mostly roadway, from the top of Mt. Jimba head down the grassy slope to pick up the start of trail that will lead to the roadway. 2) Less roadway and more trail, though very steep downhill, and difficult in places, take either of the options mentioned above before getting to Mt. Jimba, or take a path off to the right just before the last set of steps up to the very top of Jimba. 

This part of the hike is not so well signed, but there are a few white signs directing to the bus stop along the way. 

If taking the steep trail option follow trees with yellow or white markers, to help stay on course.

Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail follows a stream for about 10 min,  before joining the roadway, from here it is 1.3km to the bus stop. The bus stop is to the left and slightly downhill when entering the center of the very small village.

The Bus Stop, the bus takes about 40mins to get back to Takao town, and only runs approx every hour.

Unfortunately there are not so good options for eating at the end of the hike, so be sure to take advantage of the places at Kobotoke and Kagenobu peaks.
