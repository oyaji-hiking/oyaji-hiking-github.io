**Difficulty** : Easy 2/5 - Very few steep sections, low elevation < 700m, ~12km distance.

**Getting There**
From Tokyo take Keio line train from Shinjuku to Takaosanguchi station, change trains at Kitano.

The first part of this hike is the same as the first sections of an earlier hike posted, [see here](https://oyaji-hiking.github.io/2018/03/17/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba.html). From Takaosanguchi train station head for the top of Takao, and from there to Kobotoke-Shiroyama.

Typical tree root lined trail on Takao.

View from first rest stop, about halfway to top of Mount Takao.

From the viewing point at the top of Takao on a clear day, Mt Fuji can be seen in the distance, but too cloudy on this day.

The trail is very well maintained between Takao and Mt Kobotoke, and signed all the way.

At this sign, the trail offers two paths to Kobotoke, either is ok, but the right fork has a section of roadway, which may not be preferred, take the left fork to avoid.

Some forestry evident on this hillside, ( possibly removing the non-native cedar trees ).
![IMG_1021](/content/images/2018/09/IMG_1021.JPG)

There is a basic, but otherwise really nice rest area at the top of Kobotoke, shaved ice with flavoring seemed to be popular in the hot weather.

From the top of Kobotoke, find the sign pointing to Lake Sagami, the entrance to the trail is at the back of the rest area.

The trail to Sagami is nearly all under trees in the forest, and mostly downhill, it is approx 3km, follow sign to Bentenn Bridge. Look for the small statues at the side of the trail when getting nearer to Lake Sagami.

At the end of the trail, there is small town, head through that, and then onto route 20, which after a couple of km will arrive at Sagamiko.

Small rice fields, rice soon ready to harvest by the looks of it.

Route 20 is a little busy with traffic, but some nice views off to the side on the way to Sagamiko.

A school sports event taking place near to Sagamiko :

The original plan for the end of this hike was to spend some time walking around the lake in the area, which also has at least one nice looking park. However, the weather was closing in, and it had started raining, so this was cut short. The lake area awaits for a future visit !

**Getting Home**

Take the Chuo line train home from Sagamiko station, it goes back to Takao station and then onto Shinjuku and Tokyo stations.
