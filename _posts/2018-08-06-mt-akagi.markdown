Once finished at the shrine, retrace steps back over the bridge and continue along the main road ( continue in same direction walking away from the car park and shops area), until you see the start of the trail, and climb up to Mt Kurobisan

This part of the hike is fairly steep over rocky trail, and will be made much more difficult in bad weather.

A few places along the climb allow for some great views of the lake below, the lake itself sits at approx 1400m elevation

At the top of Kurobisan, at 1828m there is sign pointing to a viewing point nearby, it is worth checking this out.

When finsihed at the viewing area, head back to the Kurobisan peak spot, and from there follow signs to Mt. Komagatake (駒ケ岳), after Mt. Komagatake, follow signs back to Lake Onuma (大沼), and the end of the hike. 

There are many nice looking soba restaurants in the area, so be sure to try one before heading back to Takasaki.
