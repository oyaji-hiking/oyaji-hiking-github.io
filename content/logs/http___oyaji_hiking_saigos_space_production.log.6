Jimba. The first is 2.4km from Mt. Jimba, and 2.8km to the bus stop, as shown above. The next is 1.5km from Mt. Jimba, and a little harder to spot, as below :</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-11.41.58.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-11.41.58\"></p>\n<p>Views from the top of Mt.

Jimba it is 4km to 5km to get back to the bus stop, to get the bus back to Takao town train station, and train back to Tokyo. There are two options, 1) Mostly roadway, from the top of Mt. Jimba head down the grassy slope to pick up the start of trail that will lead to the roadway. 2) Less roadway and more trail, though very steep downhill, and difficult in places, take either of the options mentioned above before getting to Mt. Jimba, or take a path off to the right just before the last set of steps up to the very top of Jimba.</p>\n<p>This part of the hike is not so well signed, but there are a few white signs directing to the bus stop along the way.</p>\n<p>If taking the steep trail option follow trees with yellow or white markers, to help stay on course.</p>\n<p>Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail follows a stream for about 10 min,  before joining the roadway, from here it is 1.3km to the bus stop. The bus stop is to the left and slightly downhill when entering the center of the very small village.</p>\n<p>The Bus Stop, the bus takes about 40mins to get back to Takao town, and only runs approx every hour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-13.13.43-1.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-13.13.43-1\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately there are not so good options for eating at the end of the hike, so be sure to take advantage of the places at Kobotoke and Kagenobu peaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Route Overview and Profile</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/File-2018-03-17-20-08-04.jpeg\" alt=\"File-2018-03-17-20-08-04\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-13.18.42-2.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-13.18.42-2\"></p>\n</div>","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-10.11.55-1.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Nathan","slug":"nathan","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba/","comment_id":"5aace429bc560e16c9ee2c31"},"_locals":{"version":"1.19.2","safeVersion":"1.19","relativeUrl":"/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba/amp/","secure":true,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"f80f3df6fc3b"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"65d0-ucQ4cCBphC5VrLaDYKQMZSY8oeI\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"475ms"},"msg":"","time":"2019-04-06T14:51:36.646Z","v":0}
