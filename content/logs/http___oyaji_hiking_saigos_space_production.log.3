Jimba. The first is 2.4km from Mt. Jimba, and 2.8km to the bus stop, as shown above. The next is 1.5km from Mt. Jimba, and a little harder to spot, as below :</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-11.41.58.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-11.41.58\"></p>\n<p>Views from the top of Mt.

Jimba it is 4km to 5km to get back to the bus stop, to get the bus back to Takao town train station, and train back to Tokyo. There are two options, 1) Mostly roadway, from the top of Mt. Jimba head down the grassy slope to pick up the start of trail that will lead to the roadway. 2) Less roadway and more trail, though very steep downhill, and difficult in places, take either of the options mentioned above before getting to Mt. Jimba, or take a path off to the right just before the last set of steps up to the very top of Jimba.</p>\n<p>This part of the hike is not so well signed, but there are a few white signs directing to the bus stop along the way.</p>\n<p>If taking the steep trail option follow trees with yellow or white markers, to help stay on course.</p>\n<p>Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail follows a stream for about 10 min,  before joining the roadway, from here it is 1.3km to the bus stop. The bus stop is to the left and slightly downhill when entering the center of the very small village.</p>\n<p>The Bus Stop, the bus takes about 40mins to get back to Takao town, and only runs approx every hour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-13.13.43-1.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-13.13.43-1\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately there are not so good options for eating at the end of the hike, so be sure to take advantage of the places at Kobotoke and Kagenobu peaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Route Overview and Profile</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/File-2018-03-17-20-08-04.jpeg\" alt=\"File-2018-03-17-20-08-04\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-13.18.42-2.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-13.18.42-2\"></p>\n</div>","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-10.11.55-1.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"tags":{},"author":{"id":"1","name":"Nathan","slug":"nathan","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba/","comment_id":"5aace429bc560e16c9ee2c31"},"_locals":{"version":"1.19.2","safeVersion":"1.19","relativeUrl":"/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba/amp/","secure":true,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"f80f3df6fc3b"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"65d0-ucQ4cCBphC5VrLaDYKQMZSY8oeI\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"155ms"},"msg":"","time":"2019-04-09T06:11:36.834Z","v":0}

The bus stop a short walk from the cable car station :</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0501-2.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0501-2\"></p>\n<p>Take the short walk up the steep hill from the bus stop, pass the cable car entrance on the right, ( cable cars are for wimps ), and then turn left, through the old gateway. Follow the winding forest road for about 50mins until arriving at the shrine near the top of Mt. Mitake.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0503.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0503\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0504-1.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0504-1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0507.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0507\"></p>\n<p>Follow the steps up the shrine and and continue heading up and around to the left, there is a 20min walk or so through the winding streets of Oshi village, with some glimpses of far off views over the roof tops</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0506.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0506\"></p>\n<p>Follow signs for Mt. Odake, after leaving the village the trail turns to forest path again, there are few options presented on how to get to Mt Odake from here, via some waterfalls and rock gardens, via another couple of peaks, or more direct, as shown by this handy map found on the route :</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0509.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0509\"></p>\n<p>Taking the direct route, the trail continues for a few kilometres, before entering a clearing, here there is an old shrine and some places to sit and catch breath, worth a rest here as the next section is the final steep climb to the top of Mt Odake. Some sections have chains to help clamber over the steep rocky sections.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0510-1.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0510-1\"></p>\n<p>The climb is rewarded with some great views from the 1256.5m summit :</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0512.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0512\"><br>\n<img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0513.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0513\"><br>\n<img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0511-1.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0511-1\"></p>\n<p>From Mt Odake, it is a few more kilometeres of ridgeline trail along the Nokogiri ridge to Mt. Nokogiri.  The Nokogiri ridgeway is a nice section to hike, some gentle trail with some more challenging sections</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0514-1.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0514-1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0515.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0515\"></p>\n<p>Mt Nokogiri doesnt have any views, and is really just a small clearing at the peak, not much to do or see here than take a quick rest and continue on the way</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0519.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0519\"></p>\n<p>From Mt Nokogiri, there is a few kilometeres of ridgeway, and then a descent down through forest which eventually opens out to a small winding road which leads to the main road running through Okutama town in the valley below.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting Back</strong></p>\n<p>When hitting the main road, head right, and cross a couple of bridges, at the end of the second bridge turn left, and the station is a short way up that road, ( it is well signed after the first bridge ).</p>\n<p><strong>Route Overview and Profile</strong><br>\n( note, due to phone battery life issues, the last section was not recorded, but Okutama station can be seen on the map )</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0522.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0522\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0521.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0521\"></p>\n</div>","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/04/IMG_0513-cropped-cropped.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"tags":{},"author":{"id":"1","name":"Nathan","slug":"nathan","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/odake/","comment_id":"5ac0b1960d27840686399f14"},"_locals":{"version":"1.19.2","safeVersion":"1.19","relativeUrl":"/odake/amp/","secure":true,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"f80f3df6fc3b"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"528d-nQ6+gJjNQuBhk5nVumUG11Rtdv8\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"182ms"},"msg":"","time":"2019-04-09T16:11:33.730Z","v":0}

Jimba head down the grassy slope to pick up the start of trail that will lead to the roadway. 2) Less roadway and more trail, though very steep downhill, and difficult in places, take either of the options mentioned above before getting to Mt. Jimba, or take a path off to the right just before the last set of steps up to the very top of Jimba.</p>\n<p>This part of the hike is not so well signed, but there are a few white signs directing to the bus stop along the way.</p>\n<p>If taking the steep trail option follow trees with yellow or white markers, to help stay on course.</p>\n<p>Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail follows a stream for about 10 min,  before joining the roadway, from here it is 1.3km to the bus stop. The bus stop is to the left and slightly downhill when entering the center of the very small village.</p>\n<p>The Bus Stop, the bus takes about 40mins to get back to Takao town, and only runs approx every hour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-13.13.43-1.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-13.13.43-1\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately there are not so good options for eating at the end of the hike, so be sure to take advantage of the places at Kobotoke and Kagenobu peaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Route Overview and Profile</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/File-2018-03-17-20-08-04.jpeg\" alt=\"File-2018-03-17-20-08-04\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-13.18.42-2.jpg\" alt=\"2018-03-17-13.18.42-2\"></p>\n</div>","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/03/2018-03-17-10.11.55-1.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Nathan","slug":"nathan","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba/","comment_id":"5aace429bc560e16c9ee2c31"},"_locals":{"version":"1.19.2","safeVersion":"1.19","relativeUrl":"/mt-takao-to-mt-jimba/amp/","secure":true,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"f80f3df6fc3b"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"65d0-ucQ4cCBphC5VrLaDYKQMZSY8oeI\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"154ms"},"msg":"","time":"2019-04-09T20:06:35.894Z","v":0}
