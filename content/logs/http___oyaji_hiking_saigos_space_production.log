Short distance, no steep sections, gentle trails, and roads. \\n\\n**Getting There** trains for Kita-Kamakura run from a few stations, e.g., Tokyo, and Ebisu station, transfer may be required for example at Ofuna, a few stops before Kita-Kamakura.\\n\\n**The Hike**\\n\\nThere are quite a few trails around the area and an abundance of old shrines and temples, making the area a great day out for visitors to Japan. \\n\\nFrom Kita-Kamakura train station follow signs for Jochi temple. Its worth the 200yen entrance fee to walk around the quiet temple grounds, which sits in what feels like an old stone quarry, surrounded by natural rocky tree covered walls. \\n\\n![IMG_2116](/content/images/2019/04/IMG_2116.JPG)\\n\\n![IMG_2122](/content/images/2019/04/IMG_2122.JPG)\\n\\nLeaving Jochi-ji, a short way up the road the forest trail starts, follow signs for [Kuzuharaoka temple](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E8%91%9B%E5%8E%9F%E5%B2%A1%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE/@35.3291354,139.5431327,16.25z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x6018459a7645eb39:0x35a5632064e3c369!2z6JGb5Y6f5bKh56We56S-!8m2!3d35.3290215!4d139.5424464!3m4!1s0x6018459a7645eb39:0x35a5632064e3c369!8m2!3d35.3290215!4d139.5424464)\\n\\n![IMG_2140](/content/images/2019/04/IMG_2140.JPG)\\n\\n![IMG_2138](/content/images/2019/04/IMG_2138.JPG)\\n\\n![IMG_2142](/content/images/2019/04/IMG_2142.JPG)\\n\\n![IMG_2143](/content/images/2019/04/IMG_2143.JPG)\\n\\nAfter Kuzuharaoka follow signs to Zeniarai Bezaiten Shrine.
